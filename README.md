# Memory Game
https://lovely-marigold-464593.netlify.app/

This project was made with ReactJS, Material UI, and uses [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) to get a list of characters and show a certain number of them. The list of characters rearranges after every click and tracks your score. Score resets when you lose the game.
